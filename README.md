### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: History of Philosophy: __Which school should we spend most time studying?__
+ This project is conducted by Yuxin Liang

+ Project summary: In this project, I use data from Kaggle to conduct a analyze of which school of philosophy existed for longest time and have most people contributed to it. I assume that the overlap of those two results would be schools that we should spend most time studying. To understand more about those schools, I wound analyze the sentences and see what are the words that are most likely to be seen respectively.
